# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository was built in addition to the starter code that Lighthouse Labs has provided. I forked this and added on the requirements to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and my Node, Express back-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Screenshots
The main page should look something like this! (You can edit index.html - line 52, to display your own name)
